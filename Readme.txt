Hello There!!

The ArtiSearch is a Spotify Artist Search built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. ArtiSearch lets users search for music artists around the world.

1. Search for an artist to find out all the artists by the name.
2. Select an artist to view few of their famous albums.
3. To get to know more information about the artist, click 'More Info' beneath the artist details. 
4. To listen to an artist's album, click 'Listen to the album' beneath the album cover.

ArtiSearch also runs on a Standard mobile browser. It uses Google fonts and therefore for best experience Internet connectivity is recommended. The application works best on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox Browsers.


Note: The app works best running on a server since the application makes AJAX requests to spotify API. Usually, the browsers block cross-domain requests. Thus, it is recommended to run the application on a Web server. I've also hosted the app on GitHub pages.
